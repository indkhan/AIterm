> A Chrome extension that auto‑detects any Terms & Conditions page, opens an AI‑powered chatbot in the sidebar to summarize the key points, and lets you ask follow‑up questions—so users get the equivalent of an expert legal reader in one click.

### Key Pain Point

- **Users almost never read T&C.** Just 9% of adults say they always read a company’s privacy policy before agreeing, while 36% never read them at all [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-attitudes-and-experiences-with-privacy-policies-and-laws/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Agreements are huge.** Social‑media terms alone average over 6,100 words—roughly 13 single‑spaced pages—requiring advanced reading levels and over 25 minutes to finish [All About Cookies](https://allaboutcookies.org/social-media-terms-of-service?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Blind consent is widespread.** A 2017 Deloitte survey found 91% of consumers click “I agree” without reading the contract [Berkeley I School Blogs](https://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/w231/2021/07/09/do-we-actually-agree-to-these-terms-and-conditions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### Your Solution

- **Automatic Detection:** Content scripts spot URLs or DOM patterns for “/terms,” “/privacy,” etc., and trigger the sidebar only on legal pages.
- **AI Summarization:** An LLM (e.g., GPT‑4) ingests the full text and generates a concise bullet‑point summary of obligations, data uses, user rights, and high‑risk clauses.
- **Interactive Q&A:** The sidebar chatbot contextually answers questions (“Can they share my data?”, “How do I opt out?”) and points to exact clause excerpts.
- **Expert Focus:** Prompt‑engineering ensures laser‑focused analysis on privacy, liability, and consumer rights—far deeper than generic “TL;DR” tools.

### Differentiators

- **Beyond Static Summaries:** Unlike ToS;DR’s A‑to‑E badges (live since 2012), your tool offers real‑time, page‑specific dialogue—no wait for crowdsourced ratings [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_Service%3B_Didn%27t_Read?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Context Persistence:** Follow‑up queries retain clause context, so users can drill into adjacent sections without re‑explaining.
- **Seamless UX:** Non‑intrusive sidebar that highlights the original text and anchors chat responses to exact passages.
